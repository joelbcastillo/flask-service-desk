Welcome to Flask-ServiceDesk's documentation!
==============================================

Flask-ServiceDesk is a web application that allows you to use Github Issues as a backend for your user help desk.

Motivation
----------

In order for users of a project hosted on Github to raise issues, request new features, or communicate with the project team, they must sign up for a Github account. This barrier to entry makes it difficult for projects with non-technical users to interact with the project team. Flask-ServiceDesk means to remedy this issue by allowing users to submit issues and communicate with the project team without having to login to the Github.

Features
--------

* Issue Templates - You can use the issue and pull request templates from your repository to automatically populate the forms on this site. For more information on Issue Templates go to `Github Issue Templates Documentation`_
